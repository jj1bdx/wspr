                        WSPR0 4.0 User's Guide
                        ----------------------

WSPR (pronounced "whisper") stands for "Weak Signal Propagation
Reporter."  The WSPR software is designed for probing potential radio
propagation paths using low-power beacon-like transmissions.  WSPR
signals convey a callsign, Maidenhead grid locator, and power level
using a compressed data format with strong forward error correction
and narrowband 4-FSK modulation.  The protocol is effective at
signal-to-noise ratios as low as –28 dB in a 2500 Hz bandwidth.

WSPR 4.0 and WSPR0 4.0 introduce a slow mode, WSPR-15, using 15-minute
T/R sequences instead of the 2-minute sequences standard in all
previous versions of WSPR.  When confusion might otherwise arise, the
original WSPR mode will be called WSPR-2.  WSPR-15 is intended for
special-purpose use on the MF and LF bands, where it can offer a
potential advantage of 9 dB in sensitivity.  Steady and stable WSPR-15
signals are decodable at signal-to-noise ratios as low as -38 dB in
a 2500 Hz reference bandwidth.

Program wspr0 is a simple command-line version of WSPR with no frills,
no graphics and no GUI.  Many advanced features of the full WSPR
program, including I/Q mode, frequency hopping, and automatic
uploading of spots to WSPRnet.org are not included.  If you need these
features, use the full GUI version of WSPR.  wspr0 is intended for
specialized applications where easy compilation and execution from the
command line are advantageous.

QUICK START
-----------

wspr0 is installed automatically as part of the WSPR 4.0 package.  You
can download and install it independently from the URL
http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wspr0.exe .  Copy the
executable file into a suitable directory such as C:\wspr0.  


wspr0 is invoked by typing its name followed by optional arguments.
Open a command-prompt window, CD into to that directory, and type
"wspr0" (with no accompanying arguments) to see the following summary
and examples of program usage:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In transmit mode there can be up to 9 command-line arguments after the
program name.  The arguments have the following meanings:

1. Tx    - signifies transmit mode
2. f0    - suppressed carrier frequency or "dial frequency" (MHz)
3. ftx   - center frequency of generated WSPR signal (MHz)
4. nport - COM port number for PTT control (0 to disable PTT control)
5. call  - transmitted callsign
6. grid  - transmitted 4-character locator
7. dbm   - transmitter power (dBm)
8. snr   - generated S/N (for off-line testing only)
9. file  - output file name, or number of files to generate

On-the-air transmissions use only arguments 1 through 7; arguments 8
and 9 are used for generating wave files for local tests.

In receive mode the first two command-line arguments must be "Rx" and
the dial frequency f0, in MHz.  Additional arguments are treated as
file names, for local testing purposes.

A third operating mode, the "T/R" mode, allows one to specify the
percentage of 2-minute time slots to devote to transmitting.  All
remaining time slots will be used for receiving.  The percentage is
defined in a statistical manner; specific choices of Tx and Rx
intervals are randomized.  In this way you can put a signal on the air
for others to copy, and at the same time monitor the band to keep
track of who else is on.  In T/R mode the first 7 command-line
arguments have the same meanings as in Tx mode; the 8th argument
specifies the percent of 2-minute sequences you want devoted to
transmission.  In the example given above, 25% of 2-minute sequences
will be transmissions, while the remaining 75% will be used for
reception.


NORMAL OPERATION
----------------

Set your transceiver to USB mode and the dial frequency 1500 Hz below
the center of the desired 200 Hz band for reception.  By convention, 
the dial frequencies used for most WSPR activity are as follows:

Band  Dial Freq
(m)    (MHz)
---------------
600    0.5024
160    1.8366
 80    3.5926
 60    5.2872
 40    7.0386
 30   10.1387
 20   14.0956
 17   18.1046
 15   21.0946
 12   24.9246
 10   28.1246
  6   50.2930 
  4   70.0286
  2  144.4890

Be sure that your computer clock is accurate to within a second or so.
In case your computer has more than one sound device, please note that
wspr0 uses the operating system's default sound system.

TRANSMIT: To transmit, type in a command similar to the first example
given above.  The third argument is your desired signal frequency.  I
use serial port COM 1 for PTT control.  Therefore, to transmit on
10.140150 with power 1 W (30 dBm) I would enter the command

C:\wspr0> wspr0 Tx 10.1387 10.140150 1 K1JT FN20 30

Transmission will start at the start of the next even-numbered UTC
minute, and will be repeated on even minutes until you stop it
manually.  You can type CTRL+C to terminate program execution.


RECEIVE: To receive, type in a command like the fourth example above.
The second argument is the dial frequency, 1500 Hz below the center of
the 200 Hz received passband.

C:\wspr0> wspr0 Rx 10.1387

Reception will begin at the start of the next even minute, and will
continue until you terminate it manually by typing CTRL+C.


T/R MODE: Type in a command line like the third example above:

C:\wspr0> wspr0 T/R 10.1387 10.140150 1 K1JT FN20 30 25

At the start of the next even minute the program will start a series
of transmission or reception intervals.  A random number generator
will determine whether a particular interval will be Tx or Rx; on
average, the percentage of transmission intervals will be approach the
number specified by argument #8.


LOCAL TESTS BETWEEN TWO COMPUTERS
---------------------------------

Be sure that both computer clocks are accurate to within a second or
so.

On the "transmit" computer, to send WSPR data at S/N -26 dB, type
something like this:

C:\wspr0> wspr0 Tx 10.1387 10.140080 0 K1JT FN20 20 -26

The frequencies are arbitrary, but the frequency difference will
determine the audio tone generated.  Transmission will start on the
next even minute, and will be repeated on even minutes until you stop
it manually.  (You can type CTRL+C to terminate program execution.)

On the "receive" computer, type in a command like

C:\wspr0> wspr0 Rx 10.1387

The frequency is arbitrary.  Reception will begin at the top of the
next even minute, and will continue until terminated manually.

You can also do this test with a single computer.  Just open two
command windows, one for Tx and one for Rx.  Use an audio cable to
patch soundcard output into soundcard input, or simply use the speaker
to "transmit" and the computer mike to "receive".

LOCAL TESTS WITH ONE COMPUTER
-----------------------------

You can generate a set of three test files at specified S/N level by
entering a command like this:

C:\wspr0> wspr0 Tx 10.1387 10.140200 0 K1JT FN20 30 -26 3

These files may then be "received" and decoded by entering this
command:

C:\wspr0> wspr0 Rx 10.1387 00001.wav 00002.wav 00003.wav


GENERATING A MULTI-SIGNAL TEST FILE
-----------------------------------

If you set snr = 10 on the command line, wspr0 will generate a file
containing ten distinct signals at 20 Hz intervals, with progressive
time offsets of 0.1 s relative to the first one, and with S/N -21,
-22, ... -30 dB.  This feature was designed for testing the
multi-signal decoder.  Here is a complete example of its use:

C:\wspr0> wspr0 Tx 10.1387 10.140200 0 K1JT FN20 30 10 test.wav
  10.138700  10.140200  10.0  K1JT FN20 30            test.wav

C:\wspr0> wspr0 Rx 10.1387 test.wav
 UTC        Sync dB   DT    Freq       Message
--------------------------------------------------
test         12 -21  0.0  10.140010  K1JT FN20 30          
test         10 -22  0.1  10.140030  K1JT FN20 30          
test          9 -22  0.2  10.140050  K1JT FN20 30          
test          9 -24  0.3  10.140070  K1JT FN20 30          
test          7 -25  0.4  10.140090  K1JT FN20 30          
test          5 -25  0.5  10.140110  K1JT FN20 30          
test          5 -26  0.6  10.140130  K1JT FN20 30          
test          4 -28  0.6  10.140150  K1JT FN20 30          
test          3 -29  0.8  10.140170  K1JT FN20 30          
test          2 -29  0.8  10.140190  K1JT FN20 30          


GENERATING A LIST OF TX TONE FREQUENCIES
---------------------------------------- 

As an aid to those wishing to build a hardware-based or
microprocessor-based transmitter for WSPR signals, you can request
the program to output the list of tone frequencies corresponding to
the WSPR signal carrying a particular message.  To do this, simply
set snr to 11 on the command line.  Shown below is a complete example
of this usage.  The table has one line for each of the 162 symbols in
an WSPR transmission.  Column 2 gives the tone number (0-3) for
each 4-FSK symbol; column 3 gives the tone frequency in Hz.  Each tone
should last for 8192/12000 = 0.6827 seconds, and transitions between
tones should be done in a phase-continuous manner.
